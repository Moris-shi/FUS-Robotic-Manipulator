# FUS-Robotic-Manipulator


 
Please read through the FUS report first which will contain all information on development of the manipulator and assembly instructions

 

The robot CAD files section contains all the components in .stl format. This was 3D printed on a Ultimaker 2+ connect printer but any other 3D printer with a sufficent build volumn could be used. For 3D printing, import the .stl files into Ultimaker Cura available at https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/.
The following quantities of each file is needed:

•	1 x Base Mount

•	1 x Stepper Motor Mount

•	1 x Top Mount

•	4 x Slider

•	4 x Base Support Legs

•	1 x Sideways Support Mount

•	4 x Stepper Motor TB6600 Controller Mount

•	1 x LCD Mount

•	1 x Arduino Mount

•	1 x Joystick Mount

•	10 x Tendon Ligaments

•	1 x Ultrasonic Transducer Mount


 

The hardware section contains an Excel spreadsheet with all the hardware which needs to be purchased including prices (UK) and non-sponsored, sourcing links.


Robot Code section contains the required Arduino codes for the project
